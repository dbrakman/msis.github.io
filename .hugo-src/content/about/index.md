My name is **Mohamed Saad Ibn Seddik**.
I am passionate about *science* and *technology* for as long as I can remember.
I have an *engineering degree* in **Robotics** and a *Ph.D.* in **Autonomy and Localization for Underwater Vehicles**.

Currently, I am working as a *postdoctoral researcher* at **MIT**.
I set up the game mechanics for a human-robot competition [Aquaticus][1].
The idea is to have humans and robots play as teammates a *capture the flag game*.
I am also developing an *online course* for students, and curious individuals in general, to learn about the the **[MOOS][2]** robotics middleware.

I am interested in **software architecture** for **robotics**, **autonomous vehicles**, **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence** and **interval analysis**.
